# What is deployed currently?

## Concept

Kuberpult defines the *should* state (what should be deployed),
while Argo CD handles the *current* state (what is deployed).


## Looking up the current version in kuberpult

### Release Dialog
Under the green section "development", you can see which version is currently deployed on `development`:

### Overview
![](../assets/img/whatsdeployed/overview.png)
On the overview (home page), you can already see that:
* this service is deployed on `2` environments in the `D` (`dev`) environment-group.
* this service is not deployed anywhere else, because there's no other indicators apart from `D(2)`.

### History
On the history page, you can see the same information as on the overview:

### API
If you want to know the commit information of the currently deployed version of an application on an environment you can call this endpoint:
`GET https://your.kuberpult.host.example.com/api/environments/${targetEnvironmentName}/applications/${targetAppName}/commit`
