# kuberpult Readme for users

## About

`kuberpult` is a tool that manages *versions* of microservices in different *environments*.

A separate git repository is used that contains versions of each microservice.

`kuberpult` does not actually `deploy`. That part is usually handled by argoCD.

`kuberpult` has a UI, and it can handle *locks*. When something is locked, it's version will not be changed.
Both *environments* and *microservices* can be `locked`.

## Current Version and Queued Version

Every app has a current version on every env (including `nil` for no version).
If a deployment starts while the app/env is locked,
instead of changing the current version, the `queued_version` will be set.
When the lock is deleted, the queued version will be deployed.

There is currently no visualization for the queue in the ui,
so it can only be seen in the manifest repo as "queued_version" symlink next to "version".

The queue has a length of 0 or 1.
Attempting to put a version into the full queue, will overwrite it instead ("last deployment wins").

## Release train Overview

### What is that?

A release train is a concept that ensures that we deploy *often* and *regularly*.
The idea is that the train does not wait for you - it will leave (deploy) on time, regardless of how many services/commits are ready.

The train should run *often enough* to not slow down development, while also giving the testers enough time to look at changes before they go live.

### Trigger

The release train needs to be triggered externally - there is nothing in `kuberpult` that triggers it.
The trigger is usually implemented as a jenkins pipeline with a cronjob.
See `k8s-jenkins-cac.tf` in your project.

### Environments

There are 2 environments involved:
* *target*: this is where the services will be deployed (where the version changes happen).
* *upstream*: this is where the system tests are run. It is also the source for the *versions* of the apps.

### Process

See file `releaseTrain.groovy` in [jenkins-shared-libraries](https://github.com/freiheit-com/jenkins-shared-libraries/tree/master/vars) for the implementation.

1) *upstream* is **locked**
1) system tests are run on *upstream*
1) if the tests were OK, the actual release train (kuberpult) is called with *target*:
   * All app versions are read from *upstream*
   * A commit is created that deploys all versions that are *different* to *target*
     (if target or an app is locked, the deployment will be queued instead)
1) *upstream* is **un**locked
